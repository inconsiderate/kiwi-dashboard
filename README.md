# Kiwi-Dash

This is a side-project and my first attempt at using React.

A dashboard app to use in the office. Because we have many different applications and micro-services, I built this so devs can easily find out current project status in case they need to pull down a repo they're not familiar with.

Displays helpful information for each of our repositories/applications:

* Datetime of last deploy, and relevant git tag.
* Current version number for the dev branch. ex: "rc-1.14.0"
* Status of CI tests. ex: Flashing yellow or Solid red.
* Current code coverage. ex: 72%
